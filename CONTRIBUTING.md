# Contributing to Workflow Hub

Professional guidelines for contributing to the Workflow Hub project. These standards ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistent developer experience.

## Development Philosophy

Workflow Hub follows modern React development practices with emphasis on accessibility, performance, and maintainability. All contributions should align with these principles:

- **Accessibility First**: Every feature must support WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance Focused**: Maintain sub-second load times and smooth interactions
- **Mobile Responsive**: All components must work across device sizes (320px - 1920px+)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with comprehensive type definitions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control

### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/workflow-hub.git
cd workflow-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Check code quality
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Implement proper error handling with typed exceptions
- Maintain 100% type coverage for public APIs

### React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement React.memo for performance-critical components
- Follow custom hooks pattern for reusable logic
- Use proper key props in lists and iterations

### CSS and Styling
- Follow BEM methodology for component naming
- Use Tailwind utility classes consistently
- Maintain responsive design patterns
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming

## Component Development

### Component Structure
Each component should follow this pattern:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';

interface ComponentNameProps {
  // Define props interface
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({
  // Destructure props
}) => {
  // Component logic with proper error boundaries
  // Accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management)
  // Responsive design considerations
  // Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)

  return (
    // JSX with semantic HTML and accessibility attributes
  );
};
```

### Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must have proper ARIA labels
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Respect user motion preferences (useReducedMotion)
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Support screen reader announcements

### Performance Requirements
- Use React.memo for components that re-render frequently
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use useCallback for event handlers
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize bundle splitting for large dependencies

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Write tests for all utility functions
- Test component rendering and user interactions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test component integration points
- Validate data flow between components
- Test error boundaries and edge cases

### Accessibility Testing
- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- High contrast mode validation

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submission
1. **Code Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # ESLint validation
   npm run format        # Prettier formatting
   npm run test          # Test suite execution
   npm run test:coverage # Coverage analysis
   ```

2. **Accessibility Validation**
   - Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
   - Test with keyboard navigation
   - Validate screen reader compatibility

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Check bundle size impact
   - Validate Core Web Vitals
   - Test on multiple device sizes
